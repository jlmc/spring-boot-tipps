## Event Stream platform

1. An *Even streaming platform allows* the application to produce and consume a stream of records, as like a messaging service, 
  - You can think of this as a `Pub Sub Model`.
    - The producer and consumer here are independent of each other, meaning the producer has no clue about which consumer is going to read this message.

2. An even streaming platform also *stores* the stream of events so that it can be replayed if it's necessary, events are generally retained in multiple servers for people waiting for **tolerance** and **availability**.

3. An Even streaming platform also allows the application to process the records as they occur.

ðŸ‘†Basically, these three principles form the foundation for the event streaming platform, Apache Kafka, build on top of these principles.


### Traditional Messaging system vs kafka

#### Traditional Messaging System

- Transient Message Persistence
  - after the message has read by the consumers, the message will be removed from the message broker. 
- Brokers are responsibility to keep tack of consumed messages.
  - and remove them from the broker when the message are read.
- Target a specific consumer, to read a message from the broker.
- Not a distributed system


#### kafka Stream platform

- Store events based on a retention time. events are Immutable, once the records are sent to kafka, then it cannot be altered.
- It is responsibility of the consumer to keep track of the consumed messages
- Any Consumer can access a message from the broker.
- It is a distributed streaming system. 
  - a distributed system in general is proven to handle the load very well and has the intelligence to distribute the Load.



## Kafka Topic and Partitions

### Topic

![img.png](docs/kafka-topic-1.png)

- It is an Entity in kafka with a name. We can think a topic like a table in a database.
- lives in general inside the kafka broker.
- topic clients uses the topic name to produce and consume messages.
  - The behavior of kafka consumer is to pull continuously for new messages.
  - The kafka produce in general produces a message into the topic, if something outside invokes a producer. but even here the producer use the topic name to push a message.
  - One quick thing to retain out here is that even though the record is read by the consumer the message still resides inside the kafka, has the defined retention time

### Partitions

![kafka-partitions-1.png](docs/kafka-partitions-1.png)

- Is **where the messages lives inside the topic**.
- Each topic will be created with one or more partitions. it is pretty common practice to have more than one partition.

- each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records. that means once a record is produced, it cannot be changed at all.

- Each record as a sequential number associated, that number is called `offset`, the offset is generated when a record is published to the topic.
  - The offset play a very important role when it comes to consumers.

- Each partition is independent of each other and that is why we see that the offset in both partitions stars with zero and it continues to grow independently.
- Ordering is guarantted only at Partition level. If we have a use case where we would like to publish and read the records in a certain order, then we have to make sure to publish the records to the same partition.
- All records are persisted in a commit log in the file system where the kafka is installed. very simmilar to a database transactions.


## Setup kafka

- [setup v.2.x.x](docs/setup-under-3v.md)
- [setup v.3.x.x](docs/setup.md)

## Sending Message With Key

The kafka message is composed with to things, the value and a key. The value is mandatory and the key is optional.

- We can publish message without key, but by doing that, we no guaranty of the consume order.  
  - we know that the order is only guaranteed if the messages are delivery to the same topic partition, therefore if we really want to guaranty the consumed the order we must push the messages to the same topic partition. is exactly for this use case that the key is designed for.
  - Kafka guarantee that messages with the same key are delivery to the same topic partition.

## Topic offset

![kafka offset](docs/kafka-offset.png)

Any message that the is produced into the topic will have a unique ID call offset in the previous this ID is being represented by red color.
Consumer have 3 options when it comes to reading the messages from the topic.

- from-beginning: Since ever
- latest: Read the messages that is going to came after the consumers spam up.
- specific offset: Read the messages of the topic by passing a specific offset value from the consumer.

ðŸ‘†If you are building a consumer then you have all these there options. The first 2 options can be explored using the console.

- The offset of each consumer is stored in the special internal topic `__consumer_offsets`

- Consumer offsets behaves like a bookmark for the consumer to star reading the messages from the point it left off.


1. create a topic with the name 
    ```
    kafka-topics --zookeeper platform-zoo:2181 --create --topic test-topic --replication-factor 1 --partitions 4
    ```
2. producer 
    - Without Key
    ```
    kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic
    ```
    - With Key
    ```
    kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --property "key.separator=-" --property "parse.key=true"
    ```

3. create consumer
   - Without Key
    ```
    kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --from-beginning
    ```
    - With keys
    ```
    kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --from-beginning -property "key.separator= - " --property "print.key=true"
    ```


## Consumer Group

- `group.id` is mandatory
- `group.id` plays a major role when it comes to scalable message consumption

![topic consumer group id](docs/topic-consumer-group-id.png)

- Lets say we have a topic named `test-topic`and it has 4 partitions.
- We have a consumer with `group-id` equals to `group1`.
  - we have a single consumer pulling all the 4 partitions in the topic and processing them.
  - The pull and processing is always a single thread, so a single thread is going to pull from all the partitions.

- Imagine that, a producer is producing messages with faster rate than a the consumer processing rate.
  - Consequently, we are introducing a lag in the consumer and you might end up not processing the events in real time.

This is where the consumer groups comes, and may heps us.

![multiple consumers](docs/topic-consumer-multiple-group-id.png)

- Now lets say we spend another instance of consumer, but make sure ypu are using the same group 1.
- The partition are split between the 2 instance off  the consumer. The partition zero and one is taken care by the first instance and the partition two and three are taken care by the second instance.
- Basically what this means is that we have a scale out message consumption. This helps process the records a little faster than it was before.
- we can even make it much better by spending up with more consumer instances.

![4 partions 4 consumers](docs/topic-consumers-4-partition-4-consumers.png)

- The consumer groups are fundamentally the basic for scaling events consumption.


Now Lets say we have 5 consumer instances, but only 4 partitions are available for a given topic.

![4 consumers](docs/topic-consumer-4-consumers.png)

- In this case one of the consumers instance will be IDLE.

#### two different application consuming the same topic
A different common use case, is to have two different applications consuming from the same kafka topic

![2 apps](docs/topic-consumer-group-two-apps.png)

This is a pretty common scenario in a enterprise. Each consumer app will have their own processing logic. Each app can have different number of instances based on it requirements.

- In this example:

- App 1:
  - have 4 instance with `groupid=group1`,
  - means that one instance for each topic partition

- App 2:
  - have 2 instance with `groupid=group2`
  - means that one instance will consumer partition 0 and 1, and the instance 2 will consume from partition 2 and 3.

- The teams have to make sure that the apps do not use the same group id.
- This way the group id should be unique by each application.

#### Summary
- Consumer Groups are used for scalable message consumption. 
- Each different application will have a unique consumer group  
- Who manages the consumer group?
  - Kafka Broker manages the consumer-groups
  - Kafka Broker acts as a Group Co-ordinator


```
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --group app1

```
